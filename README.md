## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi everyone, I'm Srikar. I am an undergrad at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Applied Math. I love learning anything about databases, machine learning, and neat algorithms. Currently, I am in my final year taking numerical analysis, deep neural nets, computer vision and complex analysis.

Professionally, Iâ€™ve worked for Talroo as a machine learning engineer, where I designed complex ml models to understand, classify, and match job descriptions with related skills. Iâ€™ve also worked at Vogue magazine at the World Trade Center, as a data platform engineer, where I built out robust enterprise-level data pipelines and highly-scalable micro services.

Outside of school and work, I enjoy playing pickleball and exploring new spots. I like making friends so please reach out if you'd like to hang out! :)
